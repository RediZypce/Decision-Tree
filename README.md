# Flags Dataset Analysis and Decision Tree Classification

This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about flags of various countries. The dataset includes attributes such as flag colors, geographic data, and more. A decision tree classification model is trained to categorize countries based on their attributes. [Check it out!](Decision_Tree.ipynb)

# This project encompasses the following key components:

* Data Import and Preprocessing: 
The dataset is imported and preprocessed, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
EDA is conducted to gain insights into the dataset. This includes visualizations such as the distribution of countries by landmass, the average intensity of flag colors for Europe and Oceania, and variable types for predictors.

* Decision Tree Classification: 
A decision tree classification model is trained using the scikit-learn library. Different maximum depths are experimented with to determine the optimal depth that results in the highest accuracy. The accuracy vs. max depth and accuracy vs. ccp_alpha (for pruning) are visualized to guide model selection.

* Insightful Visualizations: 
In addition to the provided code, several insightful visualizations are created, including the distribution of flag colors, a scatter plot of population vs. area, and the distribution of religions in Europe and Oceania. These visualizations provide depth to the analysis.

* Model Evaluation: 
The decision tree model's performance is evaluated using accuracy scores. The best hyperparameters for both depth and ccp_alpha are selected, resulting in a pruned decision tree with improved generalization.

* Final Decision Tree Visualization:
The final decision tree model, with the selected hyperparameters, is visualized to provide a clear representation of the decision-making process.
